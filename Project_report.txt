Project Report: TaskPilot - Personalized Task Manager

Product Overview:
TaskPilot is a personalized task manager software developed in Python. It is designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks, track progress, and set targets in a secured manner. The software provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to sign up, log in, view their task data, add new tasks, update task status, and view task status. TaskPilot aims to assist students, learners, and individuals in organizing their daily activities, courses, competitions, and other tasks.

Features:

User Registration: Users can sign up and create their accounts with a unique username and password.
Secure Data Storage: User information and task data are stored in text files in a secure and organized manner.
Task Management: Users can add new tasks with corresponding target completion dates.
Task Status Updates: Users can update the status of tasks as completed, ongoing, or not yet started, along with a date-time stamp.
Task Viewer: TaskPilot allows users to view their task data, including task descriptions, targets, and status.
Graphical User Interface: The software incorporates a visually appealing GUI using Tkinter to enhance the user experience.
Conclusion:
TaskPilot provides an effective solution for managing tasks and improving productivity. By creating a personalized task manager, users can stay organized, prioritize tasks, and track their progress, leading to better time management and task completion. The software's simple interface and secure data storage make it suitable for users of all levels, from students to professionals.

Libraries and Modules Used:

Tkinter: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for TaskPilot.
Datetime: Utilized to manage date and time information for task status updates.
Python File Handling: Employed to read and write user data and task information in text files.
Exception Handling: Implemented to handle errors and exceptions during program execution.
Learning Outcomes:
This project provided valuable learning experiences in Python programming, GUI development, file handling, and exception handling. By developing TaskPilot, I gained proficiency in using Tkinter to design user interfaces, managing data through text files, and implementing secure user authentication using username-password pairs. The project also reinforced my understanding of procedural-oriented programming concepts in Python.

Overall, TaskPilot is a practical and user-friendly task management software that offers a seamless way to organize and track tasks, helping users improve their productivity and time management skills.
